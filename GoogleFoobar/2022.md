## re-id
> Next time Bunny HQ needs someone to infiltrate a space station to rescue bunny workers, you're going to tell them to make sure 'stay up for 48 hours straight scrubbing toilets' is part of the job description. It's only fair to warn people, after all.

```
There's some unrest in the minion ranks: minions with ID numbers like "1", "42", and other "good" numbers have been lording it over the poor minions who are stuck with more boring IDs. To quell the unrest, Commander Lambda has tasked you with reassigning everyone new random IDs based on a Completely Foolproof Scheme. 

Commander Lambda has concatenated the prime numbers in a single long string: "2357111317192329...". Now every minion must draw a number from a hat. That number is the starting index in that string of primes, and the minion's new ID number will be the next five digits in the string. So if a minion draws "3", their ID number will be "71113".  

Help the Commander assign these IDs by writing a function solution(n) which takes in the starting index n of Lambda's string of all primes, and returns the next five digits in the string. Commander Lambda has a lot of minions, so the value of n will always be between 0 and 10000.

Test cases
==========
Your code should pass the following test cases. Note that it may also be run against hidden test cases not shown here.

-- Python cases --
Input:
solution.solution(0)
Output:
    23571

Input:
solution.solution(3)
Output:
    71113
```

### Solution
```python
import math

#Max number of minions
max_minions  = 10000

#Length of the ID
id_length = 5

prime_string = ""

def is_prime(n):
  for i in range(2,int(math.sqrt(n))+1):
    if (n%i) == 0:
      return False
  return True

def generate_id(index):
    """
    Generates the ID of length <id_length> based on the given index
    :param index: The number that was drawn by the minion
    :return: The ID
    """
    return prime_string[index:index+id_length]


i=2
while len(prime_string) < (max_minions + id_length):
    if is_prime(i):
        prime_string = prime_string + str(i)
    i = i+1 

def solution(i):
    return generate_id(i)
```
