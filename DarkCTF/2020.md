- From the title, we can guess it's simply a XOR. XORing with the beginning of the flag `darkCTF{` gives us the key `1337hack`

  ```python
  flag_encoded = bytes.fromhex('5552415c2b3525105a4657071b3e0b5f494b034515')
  flag_beg = b"darkCTF{"
  key = []
  flag = []
  i = 0
  
  for c in flag_beg:
      key.append(chr(c ^ flag_encoded[i]))
      i += 1
  
  key = ''.join(key)
  print('Key: ' + key)
  
  i = 0
  for c in flag_encoded:
      flag.append(chr(c ^ ord(key[i % len(key)])))
      i += 1
  
  flag = ''.join(flag)
  print('Flag: ' + flag)
  ```

- Flag: darkCTF{kud0s_h4xx0r}

- This is a simple RSA challenge, so ![](./images/RSAStuff.png)

- First we need to find the prime factors of `N`
  ![](./images/pipeRhymePrimeFactors.png)

  - We find p = `31415926535897932384626433832795028841` and q = `56129192858827520816193436882886842322337671`

- We then calculate phi, d, and decrypt the cipher to get the flag

  ```python
  from Crypto.Util.number import long_to_bytes
  
  N = 0x3b7c97ceb5f01f8d2095578d561cad0f22bf0e9c94eb35a9c41028247a201a6db95f
  e = 0x10001
  ct = 0x1B5358AD42B79E0471A9A8C84F5F8B947BA9CB996FA37B044F81E400F883A309B886
  
  p = 31415926535897932384626433832795028841
  q = 56129192858827520816193436882886842322337671
  
  phi = (p - 1)*(q - 1)
  d = pow(int(e), -1, phi)
  
  flag = pow(int(ct), d, N)
  
  print('Flag: ' + long_to_bytes(flag).decode('utf-8'))
  ```

## [Linux] linux starter

- Connecting through SSH, we see that we have a shell with very few commands. We simply find the flag by exploring a bit...

- Flag: darkCTF{h0pe_y0u_used_intended_w4y}

## [Misc] Minetest 1

> Just a sanity check to see whether you installed Minetest successfully and got into the game

- We spawn on a platform with a system of 16 levers

![](./images/initLevers.png)

- Switching them up or down gives us the flag

![](./images/leversFlag.png)

- Flag: DarkCTF{y0u_5uccess_fully_1ns7alled_m1n37e57}

## [Misc] Minetest 2

> Someone messed up my world someone please help me recover my flag. Same file from Minetest 1

- Following the instructions given with the first flag `Teleport to the value you obtained from binary to decimal in the sense (xxxx, xxxx, xxxx) xxxx is the 4 digit number`
  - Lever up = 1, Lever down = 0
  - We transform `0000010100111001` to decimal 1337
- Teleporting to the (1337, 1337, 1337) coordinates places us in this nice cozy room

![](./images/cozyRoom.png)

- Looking through the bookshelves, we find a book containing the flag

![](./images/bookFlag.png)

- Flag: darkCTF{y0u_4r3_4_1337_p14y3r}

## [Web] Simple_SQL

> Try to find username and password
>
>  [Link](http://simplesql.darkarmy.xyz/)

- Looking at the sources, we get htat we need to pass the GET parameter `id`

![](./images/sqlInjectHint.png)

- So we manually try some IDs... The 9th one contains the flag

- Flag: darkCTF{it_is_very_easy_to_find}

- Looking at the sources, we get that we need to change the user agent in order to receive the flag

  - The length of the user agent must be less than 4, but its value must be over 10'000
  - Checking the PHP documentation for [is_numeric()](https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.is-numeric.php), we see that we can use the E notation
  - We can then set the user agent to `1e5`

- Flag: darkCTF{changeing_http_user_agent_is_easy}

- Using a [URL decoder](https://www.urldecoder.org/) and the Mozilla reference on [fromCharCode()](https://developer.mozilla.org/fr/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Objets_globaux/String/fromCharCode)
  - The first lines gives us `flag is SQL_Injection` (it wasn't :( )
  - The second line gives us `you are on the right track`
  - So naturally the third line contains the flag
- Flag: DarkCTF{5ql_1nj3ct10n}
