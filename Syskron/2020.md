## (Monday) [Forensics] Redacted news

> Oh, this is a news report on our Secure Line project. But someone removed a part of the story?!
>
> Hint: Î±

- The flag is on the missing part of the given image

![](./images/securelineChall.png)

- From the hint, we can guess that we need to remove the transparency

```python
from PIL import Image
# convert from RGBA to RGB will cancel transparency
Image.open('securelineChall.png').convert('RGB').save('securelineFlag.png')
```

## (Monday) [Packet Analysis] DoS attack

> One customer of Senork Vertriebs GmbH reports that some older Siemens devices repeatedly crash. We looked into it and it seems that there is some malicious network traffic that triggers a DoS condition. Can you please identify the malware used in the DoS attack? We attached the relevant network traffic.
>
> Flag format: syskronCTF{name-of-the-malware}
>
> Hint: They bought some older SIPROTEC 4 protection relays.

- The `.pcap` given shows us the port used, which helps us find which malware was used

## (Monday) [Web] Security headers

>  Can you please check the security-relevant HTTP response headers on www.senork.de. Do they reflect current best practices?
